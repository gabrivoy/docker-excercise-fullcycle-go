# Docker - GoLang

First exercise from the Docker module on the FullCycle course. Uses GoLang official image and a Dockerfile to print a message on the terminal when using the `docker run` command.

The exercise instructions are as follows:

---
**Docker Exercise**

 You'll need to publish an image on Docker Hub. When we run:

```
docker run <your-username>/fullcycle
```

We should get the following result: Full Cycle Rocks!!

If you notice, this image simply prints the message as the final result. Therefore, it's worth checking out the Go Lang website to learn how to create a "hello world" program.

The final Go project image needs to be less than 2MB

The image is available on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/gabrivoy/fullcycle.
